TL;DR: My de-fra01 node is live and ready to peer with you!

Since Oracle offers free small amd64 VMs in the free tier of their cloud platform, I am now running a second DN42 node there in the Frankfurt region. The node is public and I am happy if anyone wants to peer with it.  
You can find all infos on the [peering](/peering/) and [IPAM overview](/ipam/) pages.
